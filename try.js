/*								3. Chessboard 
							Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
							characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
							or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
							Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
							# # # #
							 # # # #
							# # # #
							 # # # #
							# # # #
							 # # # #
							# # # #
							 # # # #
							When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
							= 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
							of the given width and height.
